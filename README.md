**athena** is an authentication microservice that implements the [OAuth2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-1.3.1) protocol to handle the authentication requests and manage user information securely. 

**athena** can be easily integrated in your application as it exposes REST endpoints your client can send requests to. A base `User` model is included that can be extended with additional properties. 

(*If your application needs to store and modify user data, we recommend creating a new model with additional properties to keep the base user model immutable.*)

You can deploy **athena** on a VPS (e.g. DigitalOcean) or run it locally for testing purposes. Before using it, make sure it's been configured properly. The Configuration section shows you how to do it.
